# Thesis Detecting Mining Sites From Satellite Images

Code for generating results in the thesis "Detecting Mining Sites From Satellite Images"

There are 3 folders containing code files in this repository:

1. Folder "FLOPs & Parameter Analysis" contains the code for obtaining the FLOP count and number of parameters for each model tested
2. Folder "Inference_times" contains code for obtaining the number of images processed per second for each model
3. Folder "Performances (F1-Score)" contains code for generating the predictions on the test set, which were uploaded to the competition webpage to obtain F1-scores of each model on the test set.

The data used for this work was obtained through:
